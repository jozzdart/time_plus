/// A lightweight extension library for working with time in Dart.
///
/// `time_plus` enhances the built-in [DateTime] and [Duration] classes
/// by providing intuitive and powerful utilities for time manipulation.
///
/// Features include:
/// - Adding time units like weeks, months, years, decades, and centuries
/// - Extracting partial units from durations (e.g., only hours, only minutes)
/// - Converting durations to larger time units
/// - Removing whole units to isolate remaining time
///
/// Designed with simplicity and clarity in mind.
/// No dependencies. Just useful time extensions.

<h3 align="center"><i>Make every microsecond count.</i></h3>

Stop wrestling with `DateTime` and `Duration`. `time_plus` gives you the tools you wish Dart had built inâ€”add time units, break durations down, convert across scales, and do it all with a clear, predictable API. No dependencies. Just useful extensions that make working with time easier.
